# Polar Peril2

![cover.gif](cover.gif)

Polar Peril 2 is a reimagining of one of our older courses. Our objective was to make a more enjoyable game, while maintaining Line math that is useful for students around grades 7-10.

Polar peril focuses on combining math, physics and code to create fun interactions in our games. 
In Polar Peril, we use SOHCAHTOA and the Equation of the Line to dynamically create platforms. Doing these operations allows us to compute the gravitational force of snowballs on a slope, using real physics.

# Learning Goals

Learning goals should be understood by students at the end of the classes

## General Code Skill
* Variables
* Images
* Functions
* Animations
* List vs Arrays
* For Loops (forward and reverse)
* Creating new objects
* Code separation (Increase readability with strategic files)
* Object Pooling

## Math
* Vector (From A to B)
* Equation of the Line (EOTL: Y = MX + B)

# Course Outline
This course is broken down into 9 lessons. Each lesson should be completed in the span of one class, however, depending on student pacing,
a lesson can be two weeks long. Students who finish early can customize the game however they’d like with the instructor's help,
for instance, want to make the add penguins or more characters?

| Week | Topic                       | Suggested Homework                                   |

| 7    | Yetis                       | Add more yetis                                       |
| 8    | Snowballs                   | Practice making loops with different pattern puzzles |
| 9    | End Game                    | Better Scaling Difficulty                            |



# Instructional Method
Students participate in Live Virtual Sessions through a video program called Zoom.
These sessions are the primary form of learning, where an instructor guides the student
through the course material. Our class sizes are limited to a maximum of 4 students per
instructor and take place between 1-2 hours once per week at a scheduled time and
Day.

Students also have access to our online resources through RP4K’s Canvas Portal.
Extra material in the form of quizzes, discussions, assignments, and other materials are
provided for additional learning outside of the Live Virtual Sessions. Previous course
recordings are uploaded and students can participate in class discussions or contact the
instructor with any questions they may have.


# Additional Notes:
**Installation needs to happen before the course starts.**
Please ensure that the student has the template installed and to keep GitHub desktop installed in case students would like to work in groups. Follow the installation guide below to get started and reach out if you have any questions at [our email info@realprogramming.com](mailto:info@realprogramming.com)!
